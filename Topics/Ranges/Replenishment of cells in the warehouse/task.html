<h2>Replenishment of cells in the warehouse</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>In the warehouse, they check the quantity of each cell with the goods. If there are from 60 to 120 units of goods in the cell, inclusive, then everything is fine. If it is less than or greater than this range, then it is necessary either to feed it or to inventorize it. The code below contains a gap in the logic. What piece of code is missing?</p><pre><code class="java">fun main() {
    val minAmount = 60
    val maxAmount = 120
    val amount = readln().toInt()
    if (amount in .... ) {
        println("OKay")
    } else {
        println("Need help")
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
